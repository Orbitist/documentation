## Create your first map

Log into your Orbitist account time and click 'Make my first map!'

Give your map a title and a description.

Click 'Save'.

You'll be taken back to your dashboard where you'll see your map created. Note the 'Edit' link below your map's title and description. Use that link to update your map's title or description. 

## Add points to your map

Click 'View' under your new map's title and description. This will take you to that map.

Click 'Add a point'.

Fill in the fields that are relevant to this point. Note that the 'Title' and 'Location' fields are mandatory. 

When you've finished adding multimedia to the relevant fields, click 'Save'.

You'll be taken back to the map where you'll see a point added. Click your point to see the mapped multimedia. Notice the pencil icon next to the title of the point. Only you will see this icon on your maps. You can click the pencil to edit your points.

Add up to 500 points per map!

## Generate and share your maps

Select a base map under the 'Change base map' dropdown.

Click the 'Fullscreen' button to view the map fullscreen. You can copy this fullscreen map's URL by clicking the 'Share' button.

You can use the provided embed code to add the map to your website.

## Extend your maps

You can generate GeoJSON that contains all your points and multimedia by clicking the 'GeoJSON' button. 

This code can be used within native mobile apps and advanced web apps.

You can learn about extending Orbitist and download boilerplate projects under your 'Settings' menu. Select 'Settings' --> 'Extend Orbitist'.
